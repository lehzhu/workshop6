Whisper it quietly, but Mark Carney might actually win the upcoming election if the Liberals make him leader.

What can a middle-weight-at-best career politician who was focused-grouped into taking his glasses off do against the might of Donald Trump? Shout at public servants a little louder?

Carney can claim to be completely untouched by the Liberal's latest legacy. Carney has everything you want in a Canadian PM right now. International respect, elder statesman credentials from being a very successful Governor of the Bank of England during a very difficult time, diplomatic heft and bilateral experience, bipartisan credentials from being Governor of the Bank of Canada during the Harper years, and he's one of the world's experts on applied economics as well as monetary and fiscal policy. He could demolish Poilievre if he gets his domestic policy campaign pitch perfect and promises to bring down immigration.

All Carney has to do is convince voters who have already voted Liberal in the past to trust him and he'll close the gap immediately, and my guess is that there are very many people in the Conservative's 45% polling figures who are holding their noses and would like to stop.",36

Twitter is just more notable because it's now literally a vehicle of the current American government, as well as the personal soapbox of someone who's bought the Trump administration and is actively looking to do the same across the world.

We live in a world where our institutions and politicians post critical information in the same platform that the owner manipulates content and users accounts to hide the fact that... he buys boosts and accounts in online video games. Seriously.

The techbros want their platform to be governed by algorithmic hell and their petty interests, sure, free speech and all, but it's pretty far from ""free speech"" when they literally get to dictate what information Canadians get to see at all.

I don't think the solution is necessarily a ban or a CRTC-ordered split though, because it's also very corrosive to have people live completely different realities in their own algorithmic loops. You'd probably want to start by mandating Canadian-based government bodies and any private/non-profit institution serving the public to make information available in Canadian-based platforms.

I sincerely believe that Canada should use any opportunity available to coordinate our response with Mexico. The simple fact is that while the U.S. could almost certainly make Canada suffer more in an individual trade war, taking on both its northern and southern neighbour is a taller order.

This is part of why I think some of the rhetoric by Ford and others essentially trying to throw Mexico/USMCA under the bus to save ourselves is unhelpful. We should be alive to the possibility that this could turn into a prisoners dilemma type situation, but for now I think the more united our retaliatory measures are with Mexico the better.",632,"I don't care what anyone says.

John Turner was right, whatever you think of him and his many failings as a man and politician he was right that tying us at the hip with the US was the wrong decision. Brian Mulroney has sold us out and this is the result.",165,"Regardless of what you think of Trudeau, that was a good speech, and the fact that this will be one of Trudeau's final speeches as PM will help his legacy a lot.

As for the response itself, I like that we dated the phase 2 tariffs. From earlier media leaks, I was concerned they'd get bogged in consultations and inertia would prevent them from going through. I hope we continue to use energy export bans as a nuclear option, so I wish Trudeau made it clearer those could still be imposed at some point. i would also like us to get creative, consider stuff like patent and copyright suspension for American entities. Overall though, I think this is a solid response. The next few weeks will be painful, but I think Trudeau's positive message will help rally us.

(Sidenote, why did Global not have transcription for French questions? They were the most popular broadcast on Youtube with 160K concurrent viewers. Meanwhile CBC at \~60K had them.

I've heard damn near nothing from the UK, France, Germany or the EU. Nothing from any other commonwealth country like Australia or G7 nation like Japan

I don't want to comment on Mexico because there might be a lot going on in Spanish media that I sadly can't interact with. That said, Doug Ford's boneheaded comment that threw Mexico under the bus is aging very poorly right now. 

Do other countries never think of us? Why does it seem we're going it alone here?

15% export tariffs is the ONLY thing I want to hear from the federal government.

Edit: Everything indicates they won't do it because of the lack of concensus of the provinces. I think its appalling and ridiculous that people are advising restraint or peaceful resolution.

There it is. So the implication is that going to an anti-genocide protest in Canada should get you branded as an ""obscene woke"" and you should be punished, and deported if possible. That tracks a lot more than ""the Conservatives are pushing back on hate crimes"".

Really good numbers in Atlantic Canada for Liberals. Liberals will pick up a good amount of GTA seats while CPC runs up the score in less ridings. Now if BC gets closer then that's the race right there",42,"I think if the Liberals and NDP were smart they would lean in on the Trump issue - if the Conservatives are insisting that they're not going to just sell Canada to the US, then why are all the people supporting Pollievre trying to line that up? Why isn't he distancing himself from guys like Jordan Peterson and Kevin O'Leary and Danielle Smith who think it's a good idea to fully subsume ourselves into the US?

People should absolutely be concerned with the Conservatives - even guys like Doug Ford who insists ""Canada isn't for sale"" are putting Canada up for sale, they just want their friends to be the ones to benefit. That absolutely needs to be called out, and it needs to be remarked more publicly that if you can sell Canada to Canadians, it's only one sale away from selling it to America.",41

As the world keeps changing, and we increasingly see countries like the BRICS powers or other developing countries emerging to become economic centres in their own right, it's only in Canada's best interest to diversify. Stubborn loyalty will not help us in this new world.",3

Why should Canada spend the money on infrastructure when there are American companies willing to spend that money for themselves.  All the conservatives ask in return is temporary employment for Canadian workers and tax revenue from the companies.

Liberals unfortunately, aren't much different.  They just tend to favor Canadian companies over American ones, and like to get paid in private kickbacks from their friends, in addition to the tax revenue.  This is only slightly better for Canadians because at least the jobs are more permanent.

The NDP used to be the only party that advocated for the expansion of Crown corporations to extract and refine resources.  They actually kept Canadian workers at the center of their policy proposals, by trying to create long-term employment as well as keeping public control over those industries.

Stability.

Does Trump give anyone stability now? And does a US that swings this wildly from election to election offer stability?

> In late January, Tucker Carlson visited Canada, meeting with influential Canadian politicians and political commentators. **Speaking at an event hosted by Alberta premier Danielle Smith**, he mocked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in front of thousands of Canadian spectators.


> Many who donated to the trucker convoy through crowdfunding websites had U.S. addresses. When GoFundMe took down the convoy’s donation page, U.S. Republicans such as Ron DeSantis and Jeff Landry protested the move, demanding immediate refunds to U.S. donors. In a sample of a 12-hour period, where donations totaled over half a million dollars, one news agency estimated that over half of identifiable donations came from south of the border.


It has seemed clear for a long time that the Canadian right is beholden to the US. Now it’s up to Canadians to decide if we want these people in charge",126,"It’s not that simple.

They've been running against Trudeau for years, but he's soon to be gone, leaving them without a boogeyman. 

If Mark Carney wins the Liberal leadership he'll wipe the floor with Poilievre on the economy. Add to that the fact that the carbon tax is probably soon to be no more, with neither Freeland nor Carney planning to keep it in its current form, and it's not hard to see why Conservatives have been losing their minds recently trying to tear Carney down. They're scared.",59,"It's going to be difficult for Poilievre to keep his rhetorical tap dance going on this issue, eventually he's going to have to stake out a position that will either risk alienating Smith and some of her supporters in Alberta, or risk looking extremely weak on defending Canadian interests especially in manufacturing heavy places like Windsor where Poilievre was hoping to test drive his apparently newfound love for union workers.

His current talking points of ""Liberals bad, insert something about building pipelines and refineries which would take years to actually build and end with the Canada first slogan"" pale in comparison to Ford's much stronger language and positioning.

It's funny how a lot of the pro-Poilievre talking heads keep pushing for an election because ""we need a federal government with a mandate"". Trump could care less about whether someone has a mandate. He's attacked plenty of leaders with strong mandates, and ironically with Poilievre's weak positioning on this issue we would likely be in the same situation with the premiers and especially Ford carrying the flag in Poilievre's absence. 

At least now under the Liberals we have the federal government and every premier except one united on a bargaining strategy.",60,"Poilievre has said he is going to put Canada first but he does really need to cut Smith loose.

* NDP governments have balanced their budgets 40 per cent (or 22 of the 55) years they've been in office, compared to just 33 per cent for Conservatives and 23 per cent for Liberal governments.
* Deficits under NDP governments have averaged 0.5 per cent of GDP compared to 1.1 per cent for Conservative governments and 1.3 per cent for Liberals.
* Average debt-to-GDP ratios are similar for NDP and Conservative governments at 24 per cent, lower than the average under Liberal governments at 35 per cent, but Conservative governments have increased debt/GDP ratios at a higher rate than either Liberal or NDP governments.
* Far from being big spenders, NDP governments have actually averaged slightly lower spending as a share of their economies than either Liberal or Conservative governments at 21.6 per cent compared to 22.2 per cent for Conservative and 24.6 per cent for Liberal governments.
* NDP governments have also not been big taxers: their revenues as a share of their economies have averaged 21 per cent , similar to Conservatives and lower than the average under Liberal governments at 23.4 per cent.

I know my take on taxes isn't popular but, my beef isn't with paying taxes. I am good to pay taxes, I get a lot out of them. Decent healthcare, good roads, a capable state (not government). My beef is with politicians promising to cut taxes, increase services, and not run up the debt. That we can endless ""find efficiencies"" to juice more from less. 

I'm willing to pay a congestion tax to invest in transit and to encourage healthier, more economical means of commuting. I'm willing to pay the carbon tax to (attempt to) address climate change. I am willing to pay higher income taxes for better healthcare, schools, and social services. I'd pay higher CPP premiums to ensure more working Canadians have a secure retirement. 

What I am not okay with is every political party at the federal level calling for tax cuts in the last year. I suspect here in Ontario, we will see every provincial party also calling for tax cuts in our soon to be called election. And they do this all while promising to solve the underfunding of social services and balance the deficit. 

If we want more from our governments - as in, more transit, more housing, more health care spending, more resources for students and teachers, more paths to get those off the streets into homes and counselling, more addiction treatment beds and resources - we can't just expect the 1% to pay it; we can't just find efficiencies to pay for it. We all have to chip in.",101,"It's because of the carbon tax offsets income taxes (no rebates). This introduced by the BC Liberals. If I were the BC Government would be parading this fact around every day, I don't know why this isn't the case.",44,"It is because of the carbon tax. It was written into legislation to be revenue neutral and pay for reduced income and corporate taxes ( with rebates for those at the lowest end who wouldn't see tax savings). The BC Liberals deserve a lot of credit. I personally think it makes sense to incentivize hard work and business investment rather than consuming gasoline. 


If we lived in a world where the public was intelligent and could do basic math, this would be celebrated as great policy. But we know now that's not the case.",26,"Largely because of BCLiberal income tax cuts (partially offset by the carbon tax), both of which the BCNDP bitterly opposed while in opposition.",17,"Yeah but that's not the whole picture. Take Quebec for example, you pay $2,446 more in Quebec vs BC for low income earners but in exchange you get cheap daycare, free college education and the cheapest university tuition in the country (just to name a few)...",20,"BC, without doubt, has the lowest taxes for low to low/middle-income earners, with a progressive system that starts at only 5% tax up to about 47K.   After that, tax rates increase to 10%, around 100K and then start jumping to 15%, 17%, 20+% for earners at the 133K to 255K+

Alberta has a flat rate of 10% for up to 144K, so there is a crossover where progressive taxes are lower in Alberta, and that mark is around 100K.

Once you earn over 100K, the tax rate is lower in Alberta as 1) the percentages are lower, and 2) the tax brackets are much higher. For example, it's still 15% on incomes over 355K, whereas in BC, it's 20.5% on incomes over 250 K.

In short,  taxes are far lower for low to low/middle-income earners in BC,  but as you start to earn above the 100K range, one starts seeing a progressively lower tax burden in Alberta and certainly for high-income earners 200k+,  very much less tax in Alberta.",5,"Surprise, StatsCan just reported BC has the highest inflation of all provinces. And while in December, Canada added 90,900 jobs (largest monthly increase in nearly 2 years), while BC lost more full-time jobs.  Employment is yet another area of BC life in crisis. StatsCan reports that in 2024, B.C. added only 6900 jobs, but only by adding 31,700 PT jobs while losing 24,800 FT jobs over the year.  This is why many households have to leave the province to survive.

For last half decade BC has consistently had the highest cost of living in Canada. BC has the 4th-highest combined (fed/prov) top personal income tax rate (53.5%) among all 10 provinces and 50 USA states (Nearby states of Wash & Alaska are much lower). And BC is almost #1 in north america for 'hidden' taxation (mostly collected by businesses and other agencies), through taxes, charges, surcharges, fees, levies, penalties, fines, excises, duties, collections, commissions, assessments and concessions. All of which are laundered through bureaucracies.

[https://centreforfuturework.ca/2023/12/10/new-data-on-continued-record-profits-in-canadian-food-retail/](https://centreforfuturework.ca/2023/12/10/new-data-on-continued-record-profits-in-canadian-food-retail/)

>Industry-wide, **food retail profits have more than doubled** from levels typical before COVID. Food retailers earned net income of almost $6 billion in 2022, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019, and an average of $1.8 billion per year in the five years before COVID. In the first nine months of 2023, food retailers earned $4.6 billion; year-total profits for 2023 at that rate will exceed $6 billion.

>The sustained **record profit levels in food retail** contrast with the trend in food manufacturing, as well as other input industries (like energy) that supply the food retail sector. In those sectors, profits have moderated substantially since the record highs reached in mid-2022 (alongside the moderation of inflation in that time). But in food retail, profits have remained elevated.

>The oft-heard claim that the **profit margin** on grocery retail has not changed, and that higher profits have simply kept up with the overall rise in costs and prices, is not supported by industry-wide data. Measured as a proportion of total revenue in food retail, the **net income margin has doubled.**

Remember too that there is much more less overt and more sinister influence being spread across our border. It is very difficult for our government to even alert Canadians to its affect (or perhaps soon, easier to simply collude with it for their own political goals).

Why? Because we are so deeply intertwined with the United States that we are unable to effectively respond to it. It would be very dangerous for Canada to accuse the American government of any sort of undue influence over our politics and our polity except in the most gloved, feather-touch way, and even that would normally occur behind closed doors.

Some suggest we need a “Team Canada” approach. That idea might carry more weight if there had ever been a Team Canada working to support Alberta in the past. Unfortunately, history tells a very different story:  
  
**Where was “Team Canada” when Northern Gateway was vetoed in 2016, losing us 525,000 barrels per day in export capacity?**  
Instead of addressing the court’s requirements for Indigenous consultation, the federal government killed the project outright and banned tankers on the northwest coast.  
  
**Where was “Team Canada” when Energy East was cancelled in 2017?**  
Quebec and Ontario imposed unnecessary, duplicative reviews, creating endless regulatory uncertainty. Ottawa offered no support, and the project was lost, along with the chance to ship 1 million barrels per day to the East Coast.  
  
**Where was “Team Canada” when provinces like British Columbia blocked pipelines?**  
B.C. imposed unconstitutional conditions on Trans Mountain, which the courts struck down in 2019. Before that, in 2018, they tried to restrict diluted bitumen shipments, threatening Alberta’s economy and delaying progress.  
  
**And where is “Team Canada” now?**  
Ottawa has imposed Bill C-69, the “No More Pipelines” Act, and an unconstitutional production cap. They’re introducing electricity regulations that harm Alberta’s competitiveness and passing laws like Bill C-59 that silence the voices supporting Alberta’s energy.  
  
So forgive Albertans if we’re skeptical of a federal “Team Canada” approach that seems designed to landlock our resources and harm our economy. Maybe if there had been real support in the past, we wouldn’t be in this position now.

”

one thing missing is when Germany and Japan where visiting looking for Canadian energy. JT pointed to empty land and said no you don’t want our oil and gas. Imagine what a hydrogen plant could do for you. We have been getting sunk for years in Canada.  

so thank you Premier for standing up for Alberta’s like we voted you to do",0,"Even the Bloc thinks restricting energy exports is a very bad idea.  They have the same logic as Smith on it.

I think we need to be very careful about getting on Team Ford, the guy has been looking for an excuse to have an early election because his polls are good and he would like to get it done before some damaging reports come out and the possibility of economic damage from US tariffs have their full impact.

If all of the Premiers weren't on board, they should not have released the memo.  Instead, Trudeau should have come out the next day saying the federal government has authority on this and all options are on the table.

Ford, using is position as head of the Council of the Federation, to score political points for an election that doesn't need to happen for over a year, is the real problem here.

February 1st tariffs get imposed, parliament is prorogued and Queens Park could be closed for an election.

Living outside of Ontario it is really easy to see what this is about, and it isn't for Canada.",-17,"This what she basically wants.

• Focus on diplomacy and refrain from further talk of retaliatory measures, including export tariffs or cutting off energy to the U.S. Having spoken with the President, as well as dozens of governors, senators, members of congress and allies of the incoming administration, I am convinced that the path to a positive resolution with our U.S. allies is strong and consistent diplomacy and working in good faith towards shared priorities. The worst possible response to today’s news would be the federal government or premiers declaring “victory” or escalating tensions with unnecessary threats against the United States.  


•Negotiate ways to increase what Canadians and Americans buy from one another. As an example, the United States should look at purchasing more oil, timber and agricultural products from Canada, while Canada should look at purchasing more American gas turbines, military equipment and the computer hardware needed to build our growing AI data centre sector. Finding ways to increase trade in both directions is critical to achieving a win-win for both countries.  


•Double down on border security. Within the next month, all border provinces should either by themselves, or in partnership with the federal government, deploy the necessary resources to secure our shared border from illegal drugs and migration.  


•Announce a major acceleration of Canada’s 2 per cent of GDP NATO target. This is clearly a shared priority that benefits both of our nations. There is no excuse for further delay.  


•Crack down on immigration streams and loopholes that are known to permit individuals hostile to Canada and the United States to enter our country, and restore immigration levels and rules to those under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper.  


•Immediately repeal all federal anti-energy policies (production cap, Clean Electricity Regulations, Impact Assessment Act [Bill C-69]) and fast track Northern Gateway and Energy East projects pre-approvals.”


She's basically saying let cool down and be diplomatic.

2.

I know a ton of people who are just done with America, think that it's a sinking ship, and would move in a heartbeat. Decency and intelligence are things of the past. But Canadian immigration is harder than most think.

I love Canada. I grew up on the border and always planned to move, but I grew up poor, so I've always been very insecure when it came to money. I wanted to be very financially secure before moving. By the time that happened, I was too old (38) to get in on the points system. I was well educated, had a million bucks (US) in my pocket, and had both Harvard and MIT competing for my services as a computer systems engineer, but Canada didn't want me. Waiting too long and not being able to move is the biggest regret of my life. What I wouldn't give to have a nice little life in Sudbury, ON (the only place that has ever felt like home), going to Wolves games, and volunteering around town.

Now I'm 55 and in the top 6-8% in terms of net worth. If Canada opened its doors to me, I'd be willing to liquidate every penny and invest it all in Canadian businesses. I know many people in my age and wealth bracket who would do similarly. And I know several doctors and nurses who are absolutely fed to the teeth with our insane healthcare system who are on the edge of leaving medicine altogether but would jump at the chance to actually practice medicine in a place where helping people was the goal and not just making money.

Pretty much everyone who supports Trump and his version of the GOP is poorly educated and hostile to anyone who doesn't fall in line with the MAGA agenda. Most of the people who bring in the money, innovate, and propel this nation are fed up with being called Marxist, communist, groomers. Having a university degree in anything other than business means that you're a threat to America. We constantly get told that we're the problem and don't know how to run our lives. If Canada made immigration easy, I think that you would see the brain drain that Canada has complained about for decades go in reverse. It would be bumpy for awhile, especially with housing, but you could incentivize (or select for) Americans who would agree to move to areas outside of the top ten cities.",9,"Honestly, that sentiment of California, Oregon and Washington State joining Canada,  could gain ground.

He said his tariffs from previous term are still in place. 

What’s behind his beautiful recent friendship with Xi?

If he only taxes Canada and Mexico, he will generate more trade with China through trade deviation.",211,"Mind you he did say he was considering, he may or may not change by February 1st. He said it was because of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants coming in.",185,"Should stop all energy, potash, lumber, auto parts going south.  Stop imports of alcohol, orange juice.  Block X, Meta and tic tok.  Impose a 200%fee on all vacation/cruise sales for the US. Impose a 25% impute tariff on all goods and start building up an internal supply network.",108,"Oh wow Danielle Smith saved Canada! 

I’m happy hundreds of thousands of Canadian dollars were spent do that she can be told she’s not important enough to be invited into the indoor venue",87,"He should do it. Dude won solely due to inflation and now wants to roll out some of the quickest hitting inflationary policies to ever exist. 

While Canada will definitely suffer, it'll at least be hilarious to watch all the trumpists turn themselves into pretzels trying to blame Biden for it.",75,"Remember everyone, when the next election rolls around, don't vote for the party whose interim leader was running around in a MAGA hat.",61,"Here we go again

I work in the transport industry, one of the people that helps set up customs for the trucks going across.  We hat a LOT of customers in a rush last week (and this weekend) to get stuff across the border before Monday when the tariffs would hit.  Other, larger customers were putting plans into place to hold off on shipments so that the pricing could be adjusted to take them into account.

Then to be told earlier today that it was not going to take effect right away.

Now we can expect the same thing for Feb 1st.

Boring = predictable = being able to plan.  

Trump is pure chaos, which makes it hard for companies to(and people in general) to plan for the future.",55,"So, same time as infrastructure week. This guy is so full of shit. He should stay in his hole the next day. We don't want to see him or his shadow.",32,"There we go; so they are really playing the expansionist game.  

I am not sure that their stock markets tomorrow are going to take this well. His new coins, the old coins, the bubble and their expansionist game, they don't go together very well.

Their expansion to the world market in the last 20 years has been about the digital age and not this stuff.",27
